This personal webpage was made with Jekyll, starting from the amazing [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages) to GitHub Pages and Jekyll by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com).

Use: install Jekyll. Run `jekyll build` to build the site, which will end up in the `_site/` folder, and `jekyll serve` to run it live on a local http-server.

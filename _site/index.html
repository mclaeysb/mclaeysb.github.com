<!-- About me? I was born in 1989 and live in Belgium, waar ik taalmopjes maak in't Nederlands et où je complimente des inconnus en rue en français. I studied Engineering Physics at Ghent university and was a PhD student at the UGent Department of Geography for three years. I worked at the [International Peace Information Service](https://ipisresearch.be) as a GIS officer and data scientist for three years. Then I joined the social-purpose worker cooperative [Coop IT Easy](https://coopiteasy.be) as a software engineer for one and a half years. I also did some freelance work for some of the projects listed on this website - most notably for [Agora](https://agora.brussels) redoing the website and running the online participation platform.

<!-- # Can I help you out?

Need a facilitator, programmer, map-maker or game-organiser for your inspiring project? To give my volunteer experience a sustainable continuation, I offer my collaboration for short assignments as an independent contributor.

## How I can help

- A **delicate meeting** is coming up at your (volunteer) work: I can facilitate it.
- Your cooperative is going on a retreat to **set out the strategy** for the coming year or think creatively around a new theme: I am eager to guide this exercise.
- You and your neighbors want to **protest against a plan from the municipality**: I help you start a conversation together in which everyone can be heard, and where you can explore the different options together on handy map material.
- Your team is going on team building and you want to get to know each other in a different way by going all-out during **a mad game**: I'd be happy to set it up for you.
- Your team suddenly has a lot of **(geographical) data to process**: I can dive into and get the first insights, and together we can look for a suitable tool and an appropriate learning path. -->

> Whose site is this anyway?

Hi, I'm Manuel. I made this page as some kind of _portfolio_.

# About me

Here are some thing about me: I'm really into maps, I like to think about cities, I can geek out on maths and science, and I love teaching and learning in groups.

Wait, let me just give you a list of things I'm interested in:

- **Maps**: cartography, map projections, historical cartography, transit maps, algorithms for geospatial operations, GIS, OpenStreetMap and HOT, mobility and urban planning, remote sensing and hyperspectral image processing.
- **Urban planning**: circulation plans, cycling and the city, bike kitchens, cooperative housing models, shared space and commons.
- **Science, maths and engineering**: (computational) geometry, algebra, mathematical modeling, data science, information architecture, Fourier analysis, image processing, optics and photonics, fluorescence, lasers, x-ray physics, solid state physics and repairability.
- **Collective learning**: creative processes, learning trajectories, teaching, co-mentoring, collective intelligence & sociocraty, alternative ownership and management models, facilitation and mediation, open source / data / knowledge, commons.

# A good place for work

Whether in a professional, volunteer or artistic context, good workplaces foster good work and happy workers.

I find I do my best work when there's time to dive into a subject and study it well, when there's an incentive to be thorough, careful, neat and durable, when creativity and beauty are appreciated, when we're creating something that _works_ and is of use on a larger scale, and when I'm surrounded by (a small team of) kind and capable people, where there's a curiousity to change how we look at value, money, support, time, and where we're learning together in an open atmosphere.

I think it's important we think about our work conditions and find out which ones work for us. I myself try to optimise my habits and systems, and like to organise knowlegde sharing sessions and design learning trajectories for myself and others.

# Contact

If you want to reach me, you can send an email to [manuel.claeys.b@gmail.com](mailto:manuel.claeys.b@gmail.com). Maybe we can learn from one another. It would be my pleasure.

# More

There's more about me, but not much of it is online. Maybe you'll have some luck through one of the following links:

# Colophon

I made this website myself with only [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Pages. It was quite a delightful and empowering experience.

> Whose site is this anyway?

Hi, I'm Manuel.

I made this page as some kind of _portfolio_.

# Contact

If you want to reach me, you can send an email to [manuel.claeys.b@gmail.com](mailto:manuel.claeys.b@gmail.com).

# More

There's more about me, but not much of it is online. Maybe you'll have some luck through one of the following links:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/mclaeysb)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mclaeysb/)

# Colophon

I made this website myself with only [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Pages. It was quite a delightful and empowering experience.

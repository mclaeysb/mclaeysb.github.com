> Whose site is this anyway?

Hi, I'm Manuel. I made this page as some kind of _portfolio_. As you can see, I'm really into maps, I like to think about cities, I can geek out on maths and science, and I love teaching and learning in groups.

Wait, let me just give you a list of things I'm interested in:

- **Maps**: cartography, map projections, historical cartography, transit maps, algorithms for geospatial operations, GIS, OpenStreetMap and HOT, mobility and urban planning, remote sensing and hyperspectral image processing.
- **Urban planning**: circulation plans, cycling and the city, bike kitchens, cooperative housing models, shared space and commons.
- **Science, maths and engineering**: (computational) geometry, algebra, mathematical modeling, data science, information architecture, Fourier analysis, image processing, optics and photonics, fluorescence, lasers, x-ray physics, solid state physics and repairability.
- **Collective learning**: creative processes, learning trajectories, teaching, co-mentoring, collective intelligence & sociocraty, alternative ownership and management models, facilitation and mediation, open source / data / knowledge, commons.

What do I do for a living, you ask?

| 🏛 📚 🎓 | I studied *Engineering Physics* at Ghent university.
| 🌍 👨‍🏫 🔍 | I was a PhD student at the [UGent Department of Geography](http://geoweb.ugent.be) for three years.
| 🕊🗺 📊 | I was a researcher, GIS officer and data scientist at [IPIS](http://ipisresearch.be) for three years.
| 👨‍💻 🌱 🤝| Right now I'm a software engineer at [Coop It Easy](https://coopiteasy.be).

I was born in 1989 and live in 🇧🇪.	I speak 🇳🇱 and 🇫🇷 (natively), 🇬🇧, and a little 🇩🇪.<!--🍫🥖🍵🥨  🇳🇱🇫🇷🇬🇧🇩🇪-->

If you want to reach me, you can send an email to [manuel.claeys.b@gmail.com](mailto:manuel.claeys.b@gmail.com). Maybe we can learn from one another. It would be my pleasure.

PS: I made this website myself using only [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Pages. It was quite a delightful and empowering experience.

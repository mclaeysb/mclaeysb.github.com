My interest in urban planning is connected to my love of maps. My experiences a cyclist made me think about circulation plans, and making cities *for people*. I hope to learn more about cooperative housing models, shared spaces and commons. Living in Ghent showed my how beautiful and clever a city can be, living in Brussels teaches me about the richness that can be found in its diversity and imperfections.

I'm interested in learning in groups, through studying, playing, creating and conversing. For me, retreats are a great place to do this. I enjoy teaching and mentoring in both directions, and think Open Knowledge and Commons are the way to go. For a few years now, I've been learning about Collective Intelligence, Sociocraty and Self-gouvernance, and I like to facilitate groups.

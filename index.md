Hi, I'm Manuel. I like to facilitate <a href="/collective" class="internal">collective learning</a>, explore <a href="/science" class="internal">science and Maths</a>, make fancy <a href="/maps" class="internal">maps</a> and co-create <a href="/urban" class="internal">cities</a>.

Need a facilitator, programmer, map-maker or game-organiser for your inspiring project? To give my volunteer experience a sustainable continuation, I offer my collaboration for short assignments as a freelancer. <a href="/freelance" class="internal">Let me help you out</a>!

About me? I was born in 1989 and live in Belgium, waar ik taalmopjes maak in't Nederlands et où je complimente des inconnus en rue en français. I studied Engineering Physics at Ghent university and was a PhD student at the UGent Department of Geography for three years. I worked at the [International Peace Information Service](https://ipisresearch.be) as a GIS officer and data scientist for three years. Then I joined the social-purpose worker cooperative [Coop IT Easy](https://coopiteasy.be) as a software engineer for one and a half years. I also did some freelance work for some of the projects listed on this website - most notably for [Agora](https://agora.brussels) redoing the website and running the online participation platform.

You can reach me at <a href="mailto:manuel.claeys.b@gmail.com" class="email">manuel.claeys.b@gmail.com</a>.

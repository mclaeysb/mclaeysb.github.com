title: Some kind of portfolio

Hi, I'm Manuel. I like to facilitate <a href="/collective" class="internal">collective learning</a>, explore <a href="/science" class="internal">science and Maths</a>, make fancy <a href="/maps" class="internal">maps</a> and co-create <a href="/urban" class="internal">cities</a>.

I was born in 1989 and live in Belgium, waar ik taalmopjes maak in't Nederlands et où je complimente des inconnus en rue en français. I studied Engineering Physics at Ghent university and was a PhD student at the UGent Department of Geography for three years. I worked at the <a href="https://ipisresearch.be" class="external">International Peace Information Service</a> as a GIS officer and data scientist for three years. Then I joined the social-purpose worker cooperative <a href="https://coopiteasy.be" class="external">Coop IT Easy</a> as a software engineer for one and a half years. 

You can reach me at <a href="mailto:manuel.claeys.b@gmail.com" class="email">manuel.claeys.b@gmail.com</a>.

PS: I baked this website myself using Jekyll - 10/10 would recommend!

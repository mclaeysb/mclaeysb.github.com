About me? I was born in 1989 and live in Belgium, waar ik taalmopjes maak in't Nederlands et où je complimente des inconnus en rue en français. I studied Engineering Physics at Ghent university and was a PhD student at the UGent Department of Geography for three years. I worked at the [International Peace Information Service](https://ipisresearch.be) as a GIS officer and data scientist for three years. Then I joined the social-purpose worker cooperative [Coop IT Easy](https://coopiteasy.be) as a software engineer for one and a half years. I also did some freelance work for some of the projects listed on this website - most notably for [Agora](https://agora.brussels) redoing the website and running the online participation platform.

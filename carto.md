As a kid I've always loved flipping through atlasses and reading maps - and the kid in me still loves this so much! It thought me to think abstractly, understand the landscape and think about spatial relations. I'm happy I can put this knowledge - and love - to use in my work today.

# How I can help you

<div class="focus" markdown="1">

## I make <mark>interactive and printed maps</mark>.

You have a lot of data and want to show it on a map? I use <mark>state-of-the-art</mark> tools to visualise your data as a static (printable) map or interactive (web-based) map. Together, we find the right balance between telling a story and making your data explorable.

Layer by layer, I carefully build up your map, complementing your data with Open Data, satellite imagery and graphs. With an <mark>eye for detail</mark> I take care of advanced aspects like label placement, relief shading and an accessible color system, all while respecting your visual identity.

<div class="focus" markdown="1">

## I help you <mark>make sense of your data</mark>.

You need to match data in a messy Excel-sheet with some old shapefiles and have no idea (or appetite) getting started? Great, I love to structure information! I carefully clean your datasets, combine them in the right way and make <mark>notebook reports</mark> on your (spatial) research questions. I can also help you orient in the world of statistical tests, predictive models and Machine Learning and apply the most fitting approach. 

In the longer run, I can help you set up a <mark>data processing pipeline</mark>, enabling things like automated reports, connected databases and APIs.

<div class="focus" markdown="1">

## I make <mark>geo-spatial algorithms</mark> work for you.

You're faced with questions like "how many households in this dataset lie within a certain distance of polluting factories" or "what is the shortest route between all these points"? Some incredible geospatial algorithms have been developed for such questions in the fields of <mark>computational geometry, geodesy and routing</mark> - but sometimes they can be quite scary. I can help you identify the useful ones for your project, implement them and deliver the resulting output, code and documentation. 

The engineer in me also looks forward to your <mark>remote sensing</mark> and hyperspectral image processing challenges.

<h1 class="with-margin-top">My previous experience</h1>

I was born in 1989 and live in ~~Ghent~~ Brussels. After my studies as an engineer in Applied Physics, I've followed by love for <mark>maps, Maths and geomatics</mark> and worked as a PhD student at the UGent department of Geography working on historical cartography (and their deformations), map projections and predictive algorithms. I later joined an NGO as a GIS-officer and data-scientist, making maps and helping researchers understand their data. I've also undertaken some GIS projects in my spare time: building a citizen-driven mobility plan, recreating 18th century map-style and computing the cycling potential of Brussels' streets.

I'm on team *Open Knowledge*; contributing to OpenStreetMap, using <mark>Open Source tools</mark> and sharing my own code, learnings and creations as much as possible. Let's create *knowledge for the many, not the few*.

Tools I've used include QGIS/GDAL -- Mapbox/MapLibre GL JS -- Leaflet -- JavaScript/Node -- SQL/Postgres -- R/dplyr -- Python/Pandas/Jupyter -- CLI -- Git -- MatLab -- and even Ruby/Jekyll to make this very website (10/10 would recommend!).

**I've cooperated with:**

> [Allmaps](https://allmaps.org/), [UGent department of Geography](http://geoweb.ugent.be/), [IPIS - International Peace Information Service](https://ipisresearch.be/), [Endeavour](https://endeavours.eu/), [Heroes For Zero - 1030/0](https://heroesforzero.be/), [ERU - Etudes et Recherches Urbaines](https://eru-urbanisme.be/), ...

I'm happy to share more about my previous projects upon request.

Next to my cartography work, I'm a freelance <a href="/facili" class="internal">facilitator</a>: I accompany organizations towards a more cooperative working-together.

Want to talk more? Great!

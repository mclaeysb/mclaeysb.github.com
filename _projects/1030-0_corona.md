When the Corona pandemic hit in the spring of 2021, the streets were empty of cars and the pavements and parks were full of people. A lot of initiatives called to give more space to slow traffic and ensure people could enjoy their time outside while respecting social distancing. The citizen-driven collective 1030/0 got together virtually and a handful of places came to our attention. I helped make some simple maps for two of those locations. We submitted them to the responsible commune alderwomen and -men. In one case we succeeded, in the other our request was skillfully dogged.

First, we advocated to give slow traffic more space around the Josaphat park by making the street at the *Azalea* bridge - the park's main entrance where people gathered - car free, by closing an unused street going through the park and by installing a runners track around the park such that runners and walkers didn't have to cross. This request was successful: the Azalea bridge was 'cut' for car traffic and the street along the park, a buzzy short-cut street, was made accessible only to local traffic. A bit further, the commune even experimented with a separate bike lane as they turned a street one-way. Later that summer, the bridge was opened again, but the street was replaced by a one-way with a separate bike lane, as part of an experiment involving inhabitants' feedback. This was a small but clear win - although it's sad that it takes a pandemic *and* a bunch of citizens before the commune gets going.

Second, inhabitants of the Collignon squared teamed up with bar- and restaurant owners and proposed a plan that temporarily replaced car parking with terraces. There had been calls to free up space on this beautiful square for a long time, but only little progress had been made. This time, the commune first chose to sow confusion between the different actors and pointed to the high parking pressure to settle with the status quo once again. Later, after more pressure from the region and general public, some parking spaces were indeed freed up to be used by the bars and restaurants!

Many more actions have been undertaken by other volunteers of 1030/0 (and Heroes for Zero) and related action groups in this period, from protesting against traffic aggressions over installing vegetable gardens in front of unused garage gates to addressing online traffic-related hate speech. Let keep moving, together!

Occasionnally I work from home or in a caf√© in town. It's not frequent enough to join a (paid) co-working space, but it *is* frequent enough to find use in a readily available list of good workspaces. Good public places to work from are quite scarce (the '*good*' here being, of course, very personal). Finding one can feel like finding a gem in the rough.

I made this little map just for fun. Credits to <a href="https://macwright.org/hills/" class="external">Tom Rates Hills</a> for inspiring this side project.

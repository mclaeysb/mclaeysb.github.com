At Coop IT Easy I helped create modules in the framework of Odoo, a Belgian-based ERP with an Open Source Community Edition. I was involved in various projects such as building modules for shared housing initiatives and cooperative supermarkets. One particular project was focused on building a management system for a Paris based Activity Cooperative, known as a *CAE* for *Cooperative d'Activit√© et d'Emploi*. A CAE is a structure allowing the creation and development of economic activities by entrepreneurs. It's alternative to the traditional business creation as an intermediary structure offering social rights and support by pooling resources.

With a small team of four (two coder, one business analyst and one client contact) I helped build Odoo modules for for managing enrollment, contracts, time-sheets and events. We also welcomed some contributions from the Lyon-based cooperative GRAP who used some of these modules in their organisation.

To improve code quality, we followed OCA standards but also furthered our use of code quality tools and Continuous Integration practices including the Python Code Formatter *Black*, Odoo's native tests, *pre-commit* and Travis CI.

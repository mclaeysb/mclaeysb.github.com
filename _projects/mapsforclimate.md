I made some simple maps that were used in the context of the climate marches organised by Climate Express. This wonderful group of volunteers made the climate crises a topic of care for the Belgian general public and managed to mobilise 100 000 people of all backgrounds to march in Brussels to demand action. 

These maps were made using uMap, an very well made Free and Open Source tool that "lets you create maps with OpenStreetMap layers in a minute and embed them in your site". No fancy geospatial algorithms or visual effects here, just some simple, explanatory maps.

On a final note, these maps are just a small small part in a big big effort by countless volunteers striving towards the larger goal of climate justice. May we transcend our differences and feelings of powerlessness and unite to acchieve this larger goal.

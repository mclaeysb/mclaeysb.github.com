I made some simple maps that were used in the context of climate marches organised by Climate Express. These marches mobilised 100 000 people of all backgrounds to march in Brussels to demand action, and helped put the climate crises on the agenda in Belgium.

These maps were made using uMap, an very well designed Free and Open Source tool that "lets you create maps with OpenStreetMap layers in a minute and embed them in your site". No fancy geospatial algorithms or visual effects here, just some simple, explanatory maps.

These maps were just a small, small part in a big, big effort by countless volunteers striving towards the larger goal of climate justice. May we transcend our differences and feelings of powerlessness and unite in the struggle for our survival on this planet.

This map accompanies an IPIS report on the longstanding crisis in the Central African Republic. IPIS points out that access to resources remains the predominant driver of both armament and conflict in CAR. 

This map lets researchers investigate the relation between conflict drivers, actors and incidents. Various layers are available to study the spatial layout and interaction of these issues. The main layer includes more then 3000 geolocalised incidents collected from various databases, newspapers and reports. These contain information about the location, date and type of incident, the number of casualties, the incident's description and the actors involved. Incidents can be explored using a time-line and various filters.

Two thirds of all reported incidents are characterised predominantly by violence against civilians, particularly in key pastoralists and mining locales. Roadblocks generate revenue for both the state and armed groups and roadside taxation has reached such an extent that it asphyxiates the economy. Humanitarians are increasingly targeted.

This map is made using Mapbox GL JS and some vanilla JS and D3 on the front end, and uses PostgreSQL, PHP and GeoServer in the back-end.

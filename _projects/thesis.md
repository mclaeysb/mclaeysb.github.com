During my master thesis, I studied the properties of two promising conversion phosphors for white LEDs. White LEDs can be created by coating a blue- or UV-emitting LED with a conversion phosphor, whose luminescent properties make it absorb part of the short-wavelength light and re-emit it at longer wavelengths, creating an overall broad emission spectrum. Good phosphors should have good absorption of the short-wavelength light, low conversion losses and wide emission bands.

During this study, Ca<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>:Ce and Ca<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>:Eu, were investigated in a combined photoluminescence (PL) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study. These materials show wide emission bands in the blue, resp. orange part of the spectrum and a high chemical and thermal stability. I applied XANES linear combination fitting to investigate the fractions of tri- and tetravalent dopants, and used EXAFS fitting to study how and where these dopants build into the crystallographic structure. Finally I explored the possibility of using a combination of both phosphors for creating a white LED.

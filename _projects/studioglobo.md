Studio Globo is a Belgian NGO specialized in development education. They create learning experiences for preschool, primary, secondary and higher education, allowing children and students to discover the world, learn about positive ways to approach diversity and contribute to a sustainable and solitary world.

When designing new course material for the primary school level (10-12 year olds) around life in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Studio Globo reached out to a group of volunteers to create a classroom game on deforestation. A small team of volunteers gathered with a variety of experiences in youth work, education and research, and developed the game in close collaboration with Studio Globo. The game was later materialised and is currently used in classes all over the country.

The game is aimed to let children learn about the causes of deforestation, it's consequenses and possible solutions. Children play the role of local communities, confronted with the arrival of international companies, unrespected land rights, difficult harvests, economic incentives, bribery, the advent of new agricultural technologies and other events that impact the forest and their land. They are (sometimes) given the choice between possible decisions or actions they can take as an individual community, and the game later evolves to a cooperative approach between communities.

I made this overnight once - couldn't help myself. 

I can stare at transitmaps for ages, have read many scientific papers about optimising transit map layout and can get lost in the corners of the web where transitmap aficionados celebrate transit maps and diagrams from around the world.

It would be a dream come true to help design an official transit map.

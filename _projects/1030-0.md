Together with a group of fellow inhabitants of Schaerbeek (Brussels), I made an alternative circulation plan. Drawing from similar intitatives in Ghent and Leuven, we studied the possibilities to stop through traffic, give back parts of the public space to slower modes of transport and work towards more inclusive, ecological and shared forms of mobility. Our plan was submitted to the newly council.

In classic projectors, light is imaged using lenses from a (computer-controlled) pixelated optical system (e.g. an LCD display) onto a screen. In the fields of Fourier Optics and Computer-Generated Holography, alternative techniques are studied which project images using diffraction. These are less sensitive to lens-caused aberrations and pixel-grids, have straightforward image compression techniques and can be powered by powerful and energy efficient lasers.

During my bachelor thesis, two classmates and I studied the potential of laser image projection using *Diffractive Optical Elements*, which manipulate the phase of an incident coherent light beam in order to form a desired image in the Far Field where it has undergone a Fourier-like transformation. The phase manipulation required for a desired image can be computed via a so called Adaptive-Additive Algorithm. To realize the phase manipulation, two techniques were explored.

First, we used the properties of liquid crystals in a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). The orientation of liquid crystal molecules changes in an applied electric field, and depending on their orientation, a light wave will move faster or slower through it, causing a phase delay. A small lab setup enabled us to input a desired image, compute the required phase shifts, apply it on an incident laser beam using the SLM, and create the image in the Far Field on a wall.

We also built a DOE ourselves by depositing a thin polymer layer of varying thickness on a glass slide. Light will propagates slower where the polymer is applied. In this case, the image is produced in transmission instead of reflection, causing it to be point-symmetrical.

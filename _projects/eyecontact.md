The *Worldâ€™s Biggest Eye Contact Experiment* is an international event that was launched in 2015 by *The Liberators* - an Australian based initiative organising 'global, participatory acts of freedom that allow to see that beyond differences there is love and humanity'. For the Eye Contact Experiment, the pitch is: sit down and look into the eyes of a stranger for one minute, and allow yourself to feel what happens... 

In 2016, two super enthusiastic friends had heard about it and organised a (small) event in Brussels. In 2017, I joined together with some others, and the event grew to about 200 participants on the Brussels Muntplein - Place de la Monnaie on a sunny Saturday afternoon in September. In 2018, we moved to the Warandepark - Parc de Bruxelles and held the event during the city's car-free day.

For me, this event floats somewhere between the very dreamy 'lets make this world a better place' and the very practical 'ok but let's actually just do it'. It doesn't need much preparation - just a few pillows, some creative signs and a handful of early birds to get it going. 

It's interesting to see how the public reacts. Some passers-by immediately join in and participate, and stay for one or two turns, or two hours. Giggles, laughs, recognition, tenderness, ... Other people observe at a safe distance, and many just walk by. 

For myself, a role I really enjoined was to tickle the minds of the bystanders: do they just need someone to say 'hey' to feel allowed to join in? Are they skeptical about what's happening? Or are they curious? Can I bring them closer to the threshold of participation, whilest still leaving it to be *their* choice? Somehow I felt super legit in this role, and it brought a big smile on my face.

Overall, this was a relatively small event and my role was minor, but it clarified a lot of things for me.

As a kid, I spent countless hours building Lego houses, towns, railroads and airports. I found an enormous amount of joy and patience optimising the overall scenery and harmony and maximising the infrastructure's efficiency and resilience.

While I can recall some monstrous catastrophes, I mostly remember remarkably high citizen satisfaction and feeling the pride of a content mayor.

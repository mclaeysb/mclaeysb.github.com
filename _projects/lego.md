As a kind, I spent countless hours building LEGO houses, towns, railroads and airports. I found an enormous amount of joy and patience optimising the overal scenery and harmony and maxamising the infrastructure's efficiency and resilience.

While I can recal some monstrous catastrophies, I mostly remember remarkably high citizen satisfaction and feeling the pride of a content mayor.

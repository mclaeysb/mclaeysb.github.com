As a kid, I spent countless hours building Lego houses, towns, railroads and airports. I found a lot of joy in harmonising the overall scenery and optimising the infrastructure's (imagined) efficiency.

While I can recall some monstrous catastrophes, I mostly remember feeling like a proud mayor with remarkably high citizen satisfaction rates.

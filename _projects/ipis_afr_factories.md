Africa's domestic defense industry remains relatively unknown. Therefore, the International Peace Information Service (IPIS) and Omega Research Foundation compiled a database of the main entities comprising this industry: arms and ammunition production and assembly factories, companies responsible for management of said factories, as well as importing companies. This map was made to give a better overview of this industry's size and geographic layout. 

This is a simple Mapbox GL JS map. It lets users click on a factory icon to explore its various characteristics.

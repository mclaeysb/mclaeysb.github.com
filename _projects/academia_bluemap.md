The UGent Department of Geography has developed a technique to gage the presence and movements of pedestrians at mass events by logging public MAC addresses of Bluetooth-enabled devices using strategically located beacons. This technique was put into practice during multiple events, including the Gentse Feesten - a large city festival in Ghent. City officials and the festival security room had access to a live map of the number of people on and the movements between main squares and streets.

In addition to a supporting role during the practical roll-out, I worked also on the data collected during such festivals. I explored which Machine Learning techniques could be used to learn and model the dynamics of pedestrian movements from historical data. This could be used to fill in faulty sensor data, predict future movements or estimate the impact of changes to the street capacity.

My main focus were Graphical Models such as Markov Random Fields. I also explored ARMIMA models and Kernel Methods.

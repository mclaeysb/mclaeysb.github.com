I've tutored more then a dozen students over the past years, of various age and social background. Assisting a six-year-old in here first steps into additions or explaining the Fourier transform to an engineer-to-be, it's the most satisfying challenge to level with a student's current state of knowledge and explain a subject from there on - thinking back to what made you understand it when you first did. Really, there's no greater joy than exciting an eagerness to learn and seeing someone empowered by his or here own abilities.

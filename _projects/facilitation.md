I've learned most of my facilitation skills *on the job*: while organising youth camps or hosting various discussions. But I've also taken some trainings: some on ad hoc topics, some as part of a series (like *Pratique d'Intéligence Collective*). Here are some notable trainings I took: 

In 2018, I enrolled at the week-long *ADN++* training by *Université du Nous*. During one week, we built a spectacle show and organised for that endeavour using the principles of self-gouvernment and collective intelligence. It was a lot of fun. I personally struggled with the opposition that became apparent to me between the importance of personal agency during a creative process, and the reliance on the group common to collective intelligence.

In 2020, I followed the *Posture de Facilitation* training by *Collectiv-a*. I learned to rely on my abilities and letting go of the urge to prove myself.

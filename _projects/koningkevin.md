I was a youth work instructor at Koning Kevin - an organisation hosting summer camps and youth worker workshops with a focus on creativity. Together with some very talented, open-minded and hilarious fellow instructors, I accompanied future youth workers through different aspects of working with children and youngsters: approaching communication as a youth worker, brainstorming and planning in group, playing all out in fantasy worlds, designing games and learning social skills through creative processes.

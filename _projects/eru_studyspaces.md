tagline: A support mission for perspective.brussels

I supported *ERU - Etudes et Recherches Urbaines* as a freelance researcher and facilitator for the *Study Spaces* mission. This was a support mission commissioned by the Cel Studenten Leven - Cellule Vie Etudiante of perspective.brussels with the aim to sketch the current state of study places available to students in Brussels higher education colleges and universities. It was also meant to lay the ground work for a future vision on study spaces in Brussels. 

For this research, we interviewed study space organisers and students and organised multiple workshops. I supported ERU with designing the questionnaires, preparing the workshops as well as facilitating them (in both French and Dutch).

I've used study spaces myself during my time at university, but also when working remote for work or as a volunteer. It was super interesting to hear form the students which features were important to them when it comes to these spaces. Turns out they care most about long opening hours, a quiet atmosphere and the ability to see occupancy rates and/or reserve a seat. To hear that some students were eager to participate because they were afraid the current lack of study spaces was detrimental for the study carriers of less fortunate fellow students, was both heartwarming and a clear sign that the status quo doesn't suffice - especially compared to other student cities like Leuven and Ghent. Some new idea's were also floated, including using parking discs when people take a break and leave their desks (to prevent unused but claimed desks) and a new online city-wide study space platform. I was also glad to see some players taking the lead, like *Brik* (providing an impressive amount of Study Spaces, collaborating with student to manage them and building a platform that shows availability) and *Muntpunt* (using the *Bookaplace* platform to let students, well, book a place).

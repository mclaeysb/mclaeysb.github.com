Agora is a Brussels citizen initiative proposing a different kind of democracy. Inspired by the book *Against Elections* by David Van Reybroeck, they imagined an institutionalised citizen assembly, drawn by lot, working side by side with the elected parliament of the Brussels Region. That's the long term goal. On the short term, they proposed a 'Trojan horse' approach: the participated in the 2019 regional elections, with a promise that if a representing volunteer was elected to the parliament, she or he would act as a spokesperson for an assembly body organized by Agora volunteers. This bid was successful: Pepijn Kennis was elected and the organisation of semester-long assemblies was started.

I joined the project in 2020, after the start-up phase, the election campaign and the composition of the assembly by 89 Brussels citizens (called *assemblists*) drawn to represent the region, with equal proportions of gender, age and education level, first as a facilitator during the assemblies, then as a volunteer in the assembly work-group and overall coordination and shortly also as a freelance contributor redoing the website and managing the participation platform. 

As a facilitor, I hosted discussion tables, holding the space for open and respectful creative and deliberative discussions. These were held live until the 2020 Corona pandemic hit. We struggled to restart live later that year, and ultimately had to move the entire process online. We tried to put as much effort as possible in staying inclusive and keeping everyone aboard - as difficult as this was given the overall volunteer fatigue. We've also tried to focus a lot on the well being of the assemblists and the quality of the human connections, e.g. by calling every one just to check in during the pandemic when our activities were on hold.

I'm learning a lot in this project: facilitation skills (thanks to an awesome, eye-opening team of co-facilitators), non-violent communication skills, the place of emotion in a discussion, my biases when it comes to inclusiveness or wealth, the functioning of a self-gouverned organisation and experimenting with novel approaches of citizen involvement.

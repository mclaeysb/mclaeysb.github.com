At the self-gouverned worker cooperative Coop IT Easy, in addition to her or his main role of coder or business analyst, every worker gets assigned one or multiple cross-company mandates. My mandate was called 'Intercooperation'.

Coop IT Easy is an IT cooperative making tools for the Social Economy - and luckily it is not the only one. Several other cooperatives are operating in Europe, working on similar topics like cooperative supermarkets, shared housing initiatives or short circuit distribution systems. Many of them also use the Odoo ERP framework and share their tools on Github and through the Odoo Community Association (OCA). But while these tools and networks make it possible for any organisation to share any type of code, it was clear that for the specific case of IT cooperatives that are focusing their efforts in the Social Economy, a stronger, more dedicated network would help to propel collaborations and enable us to work on some more complex projects. Therefore, inspired by the ICA principles for cooperatives, Coop IT Easy and the Catalan worker cooperative Coopdevs joined forces and started the *IT 4 Social Economy* intercooperation network to mutualize resources, share knowledge and build better tools together.

The goals of this network is to develop and maintain a common base of IT Tools and documentation and promote the use of Free and Open Source tools in the social economy. At it's start, the network focused on collaboration on two tools: a share management system and a cooperative supermarket management system. 

My role has been to organise the yearly hackaton and facilitate the workshops where the goals and tasks were laid out, following up with monthly meetings, kick-start the documentation system, set up the website, reach out to other cooperatives and spread the word within the OCA community. After I left, my colleagues continued the work, connecting with existing networks of cooperative supermarkets (especially in France) and proving the documentation content.

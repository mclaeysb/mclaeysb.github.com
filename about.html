	<em>Who's page is this anyway?</em>

	<h1>Colophon</h1>
	This website is built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and that's all.

	<h1>Contact</h1>

	<h1>More</h1>
	There's more about me, but not much of it is online. Maybe you'll have some luck through one of the following links:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/mclaeysb">GitHub</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/mclaeysb/">LinkedIn</a></li>
	</ul>

I love cartography. As a child, I could stare at maps for ages, and I've made a couple of maps myself here and there. I like to geek out on map projections and geospatial algorithms, and have a particular fetish for transit maps, and think OpenStreetMap and HOT are both *hotties*. In remote sensing and hyperspectral image processing, my interests for maps, science and Maths find a fascinating overlap.

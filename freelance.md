# Can I help you out?

Need a facilitator, programmer, map-maker or game-organiser for your inspiring project? To give my volunteer experience a sustainable continuation, I offer my collaboration for short assignments as an independent contributor.

Ik ben ook beschikbaar <a href="/freelance_nl" class="language">in het nederlands</a> et <a href="/freelance_fr" class="language">en fran√ßais</a>!

## How I can help

- A **delicate meeting** is coming up at your (volunteer) work: I can facilitate it.
- Your cooperative is going on a retreat to **set out the strategy** for the coming year or think creatively around a new theme: I am eager to guide this exercise.
- You and your neighbors want to **protest against a plan from the municipality**: I help you start a conversation together in which everyone can be heard, and where you can explore the different options together on handy map material.
- Your team is going on team building and you want to get to know each other in a different way by going all-out during **a mad game**: I'd be happy to set it up for you.
- Your team suddenly has a lot of **(geographical) data to process**: I can dive into and get the first insights, and together we can look for a suitable tool and an appropriate learning path.
<!--- For a large facilitation assignment your collective is looking for reinforcement by a **multilingual, experienced facilitator**: I'm your guy!-->
<!--- Your team wants to evolve from a classic to a more **shared form of gouvernance**: from my diverse experience I can help you explore the possibilities.-->

## Why I am doing this

It is my intention to put to good use the inspiring working methods and the diverse competencies I gathered as a volunteer in other projects. I hope to be able to keep supporting these types of projects in a sustainable way.

For example, I have come to know the power of putting up a dedicated time and space to create, focus, learn and play together - and I'm happy to help set up such moments. As a facilitator, I can help hold a space where everyone feels valued and a respectful deliberation can lead to something new. Furthermore, the engineer in me is quite good with computers, data and some programming languages. Finally, I'm happy to put my passion for cartography to use to work towards a softer mobility, a more ecological future or simply more admiration.

## What's my price

I invite you to work with a **conscious exchange**: an exchange based on the will to work together to find a suitable, fair price.

Why? I think we can and should question our relationship to money and wealth. This is also a concrete experience of shared gouvernance, something I strongly believe in. Furthermore, it allows me to offer my services to a greater diversity of actors, where everyone can contribute what they can.

The specific method I propose goes as follows.

- Before the assignment its scope (expectations, deliverables, time, ...) is agreed upon, and this method of compensation is explained and, if ok for everyone, validated.
- Within one month after the agreed end date, you make a proposal for a compensation.
    - Of course, take your own situation into account.
    - Take note of my situation[^mysituation].
    - Hold a small reflection with the people involved in my contributions to propose a compensation that seems right for you.
    - Make your proposal in euros, unless you are thinking of another option.
- I do not ask you to justify the amount, but I do have the freedom to agree or not: I can accept this proposal, ask a clarification question, give my feeling or, in extremis, object. If necessary we discuss and try to find an agreement.
- I can provide you with an invoice. You deposit the agreed amount.
<!--I hereby ask you to communicate an intention: what does this amount mean?-->

If this way of working doesn't suit you, I can also make a normal quotation for your request. Just know that I'll use a slightly higher price than average then.

[^mysituation]: My situation

    - I do this work as a self-employed person as my secondary occupation. This means that I have a main occupation (or unemployment benefits), to which this extra income is added. It is therefore taxed in the highest category of income (40%-45%). This income is on the one hand *extra* for me, but at the same time it enables me to free up working time to carry out larger, more serious assignments for the projects I believe in.
    - I fall under the 'VAT exemption scheme for small businesses', which means that I do not charge VAT on payments (nor am able to deduct VAT off my costs).
    - If you want to reason on the basis of a price per hour, keep in mind that for assignments where you stand in front of a group, a large part (usually half) of the work is in the preparation beforehand.
    - I do not charge any additional travel costs: I pay these myself using the agreed compensation.

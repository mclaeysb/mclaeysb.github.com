I was born in 1989 and live in ~~Ghent~~ Brussels, waar ik taalmopjes maak in het Nederlands et où je complimente des inconnus en rue en français.

Currently I apply what I've learned working with groups on the one side, and my love for maps, Maths and geometry on the other, as a freelance <a href="/facili" class="internal">facilitator</a> and <a href="/carto" class="internal">cartographer</a>. These two poles balance out my social, interactive and curious, studious sides.

If you're interested in my work, feel free to explore the following pages I created with learnings from some of the projects I've been a part of. There's been some project's I call <a href="/collective" class="internal">collective learning</a>, I've made some fancy <a href="/maps" class="internal">maps</a>, I like to think about <a href="/urban" class="internal">cities</a> and geek out with <a href="/science" class="internal">science and Maths</a>.

Earlier I was a volunteer at the youthwork organisations [Albezon](https://www.albezon.be/) and [Koning Kevin](https://koningkevin.be/). More recently I've been involved as a facilitator at the Brussels' citizen initiative for deliberative democracy [Agora](https://agora.brussels).

In 2012 I graduated as an engineer in Applied Physics. As a PhD student at the UGent department of Geography I studied deformations in historical maps and predictive models of pedestrian crowds. I was a GIS-officer and data-scientist at the NGO [IPIS](https://ipisresearch.be) making maps and helping researchers understand their data. At the workers cooperative [Coop IT Easy](https://coopiteasy.be) I made software for organisations in the social economy, as part of an awesome self-facilitating team.

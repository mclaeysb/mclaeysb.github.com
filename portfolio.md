I was born in 1989 and live in ~~Ghent~~ Brussels, waar ik taalmopjes maak in het Nederlands et où je complimente des inconnus en rue en français.

Currently I apply what I've learned working with groups on the one side, and my love for maps, Maths and geometry on the other, as a freelance <a href="/facili" class="internal">facilitator</a> and <a href="/carto" class="internal">cartographer</a>. These two poles balance out my social, interactive and curious, studious sides.

If you're interested in my work, feel free to explore the following pages I created with learnings from some of the projects I've been a part of. There's been some project's I call <a href="/collective" class="internal">collective learning</a>, I've made some fancy <a href="/maps" class="internal">maps</a>, I like to think about <a href="/urban" class="internal">cities</a> and geek out with <a href="/science" class="internal">science and Maths</a>.

Earlier I was a volunteer at the youthwork organisations [Albezon](https://www.albezon.be/) and [Koning Kevin](https://koningkevin.be/). More recently I've been involved as a facilitator at the Brussels' citizen initiative for deliberative democracy [Agora](https://agora.brussels).

In 2012 I graduated as an engineer in Applied Physics. As a PhD student at the UGent department of Geography I studied deformations in historical maps and predictive models of pedestrian crowds. I was a GIS-officer and data-scientist at the NGO [IPIS](https://ipisresearch.be) making maps and helping researchers understand their data. At the workers cooperative [Coop IT Easy](https://coopiteasy.be) I made software for organisations in the social economy, as part of an awesome self-facilitating team.

I'm inspired by writers and creators pusing for more open and human technology. I'm not as present online myself, but offline you might find me spreading the word about that cool user-funded markdown-based note-taking application, referencing a blog that shares some great bike-repair tutorials, or sharing about my clumsy and hacky life with a candy-bar phone.

I'm a human being, too. Proud that I can contribute with some things, also struggling with some others. Trying to be kind and helpful, and to give a place to the many other voices in me too. A person with quite some enthousiasm and belief in our ability to choose and learn and overcome, and moments where these seem further away. And while this website is about me (written for professional reasons - that was a whole exercise!), it's really about 'us', about how we are many and are one, about the power of connection, about recognising who we are -- *that* we are, here and alive in this 'existence' thing.
